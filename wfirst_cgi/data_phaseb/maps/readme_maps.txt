The Phase B surface error maps are too large to place on Github.com. They are on the WFIRST website hosted by IPAC: 
https://wfirst.ipac.caltech.edu/sims/Coronagraph_public_images.html#Error_Maps 

Steps:
1) Download the zipped file from the IPAC website.
2) Unzip the file. 
3) Move the error maps into this directory.
